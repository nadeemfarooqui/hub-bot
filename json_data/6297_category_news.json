The meeting included a recap of <a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-reports-third-quarter-2016-results/\" target=\"_blank\">our Q3 results</a> reported this week, a glimpse into holiday plans in both North America and Europe, and updates on our brand and marketing initiatives from Chief Communications Officer Dan Tarman, Chief Marketing Officer Suzy Deering, and EMEA VP of Marketing Godert van Dedem.</p><p>CFO Scott Schenkel took the stage to discuss our Q3 results. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The numbers we delivered yesterday were better than we said they would be, and the total year guidance was better than what we said before.&rdquo; At the same time, he acknowledged that some investors are looking at metrics of growth that they want to see improving. </p><p>Both Scott and Devin said that we need to improve in some areas. Devin noted that speed on our platform, payments and checkout availability, and SEO are ongoing challenges.</p><p>Scott and Devin also said that our strategy has not changed. Devin showed a slide highlighting our ambition:</p><p><i>The world shops first on eBay because we offer the best choice and the most relevance driven by the most powerful selling platform.</i></p><p>&ldquo;This has not changed,&rdquo; he emphasized. Among recent highlights for the company, Devin mentioned our recent #32 ranking among top global brands by Interbrand, our new APIs, the new seller hub, and the launch of both ShopBot and our 5.5 mobile app. </p><p>&ldquo;I give a ton of credit to our mobile team,&rdquo; Devin said. &ldquo;Our ratings on mobile are the highest they have ever been.&rdquo; Devin and Scott also pointed to continuing strong performances from both StubHub and Classifieds.</p><p><b>Brand and Marketing Updates</b></p><p>&ldquo;We were ranked recently as the number 32 brand in the world,&rdquo; Dan Tarman said. He added that we were also ranked 32 last year by Interbrand, prior to the PayPal split, which illustrates the enduring strength of our brand.</p><p>Dan also discussed new brand initiatives. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been talking about sharpening our brand,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We need the brand to punch harder, and we need more clarity about what our brand is.&rdquo; Among the goals for our brand initiatives, he said that we are focused on closing perception gaps, sparking a movement and harnessing employees as brand advocates.</p><p>In addition to noting that we are launching upcoming television advertisements during the holiday season, Dan highlighted the message that &ldquo;eBay helps every person find their version of perfect, no matter what it is.&rdquo; He also discussed the following points of messaging focus, which ladder up to answering the question &ldquo;why eBay?&rdquo; for consumers:</p><p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&middot;      <!--[endif]-->Ebay has the best choice and amazing deals for shoppers</p><p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&middot;      <!--[endif]-->You can shop on eBay the way you want, get fast and free delivery, and great service</p><p><!--[if !supportLists]-->&middot;      <!--[endif]-->We are transforming our platform to create a cutting-edge shopping experience<b></b></p><p>Suzy Deering took the stage and emphasized that eBay must &ldquo;show up&rdquo; this holiday season and &ldquo;show up differently.&rdquo; Her address showcased enhanced shopping experiences ranging from new browse nodes to holiday shopping modules that highlight eBay&rsquo;s breadth of choice and value.</p><p>In addition,<b> </b>Godert van Dedem addressed the crowd with updates on Europe&rsquo;s holiday plans. He said that customized television advertisements are also launching in Europe and being created now, with ads to arrive in mid-November. There are also plans for radio spots, and Godert emphasized that research from Europe show that these advertisements translate into real growth for our business. </p><p>Among points of focus for messing in Europe, he highlighted the fact that 80 percent of products bought on eBay are new, and our growing focus on 25- to 34-year old consumers.

They live what it means to be a leader at eBay and this elevates our culture.&rdquo;</p><p>The awards were established in 2015 by the eBay Board of Directors, and were designed to recognize those who create a vibrant future for eBay both through their own contribution and by &lsquo;paying it forward&rsquo; by helping emerging leaders.</p><p>Laura Chambers,&nbsp;VP of Consumer Selling, who described the award as a &ldquo;huge honor&rdquo; said: &ldquo;The most important part of my job is setting up the people around me for success. I care deeply about figuring out what people need in order to do the incredibly important work they&rsquo;re doing for our customers and our company.&rdquo;</p><p>Mohan Patt, VP, Shopping Experience Product, said the award was &ldquo;recognition and validation that great leadership doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed.&rdquo;</p><p>He added: &ldquo;I am huge believer in mentorship. There have been a handful of mentors who have helped shaped my career at eBay and played a big part in my growth to leadership. I enjoy mentoring and I learn so much by being a mentor. And I am open to taking on more mentees.&rdquo;</p><p>Mohan added that &ldquo;our customers and our people&rdquo; inspire him. &ldquo;Every day I feel the impact of what we do. We have loyal customers, and they want us to win. And our people: There is a fighting spirit that is uniquely eBay, that allows us to do amazing things together at exceptional scale.&rdquo;</p><p>Asked what inspires her, Laura said it was our customers. &ldquo;They need us to do brilliant work on their behalf, so that they can keep their mortgages paid, or their staff employed, or be able to afford that one unique thing that would otherwise be out of reach.&rdquo;</p><p>Two leaders &ndash; one female and one male -- will be selected to receive the award annually until 2020. The honorees will receive a mentoring session with Devin Wenig, John Donahoe and another leader of their choice. They will also be given the opportunity to attend a Stanford University Executive Education course to further develop their leadership skills and capabilities, and to help position them to drive each company forward, through 2020 and beyond.</p></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Brand is an approach and a way of thinking that is integral to a company&rsquo;s vision, strategy and culture. The most effective brands are those which inspire an emotional connection in the hearts and minds of employees and consumers.</i></p><p><i>Earlier this year, we welcomed Karl Isaac as our new Vice President of Global Brand. In his previous role at Adobe, Karl led the brand through a period of bold change in business, product, and brand strategy </i><i>that created significant brand value, accelerated relevance globally, and established a strong emotional connection with its</i>&nbsp;<i>community.</i></p><p><i>Now, he brings his expertise to eBay, where he leads the Brand team, and has - in partnership with </i><i>senior </i><i>leaders from across the business and around the world </i><i>- overseen the development of eBay&rsquo;s new brand strategy platform, encompassing the vision, traits, and propositions to buyers and sellers.</i></p><p><i>Together, the group has aligned around a strong and differentiated brand strategy platform that centers on why eBay exists as a brand: <b>to help every person get their version of perfect, no matter what it is.</b></i><i> </i><i></i></p><p><i>During the remainder of 2016, you&rsquo;ll see the brand beginning to be activated across the company. </i><i>Starting as early as next week, the Brand team will begin a roadshow in Europe and then North America and APAC to roll out the first version of the new Brand Playbook, with additional updates to follow throughout the year.</i></p><p><i>Ahead of that, Karl sat down with <b>Jennifer O&rsquo;Connell</b> and <b>Tobias Huebscher</b> of the Hub News Team to share some of what&rsquo;s been happening behind the scenes &ndash; and what&rsquo;s coming next &ndash; for our brand, and to talk about what it means to create, build and guide eBay&rsquo;s brand in 2016 and beyond.</i></p><p><b>What do we mean when we talk about &lsquo;brand repositioning&rsquo;? And why does eBay need to worry about brand &ndash; after all, we&rsquo;re one of the world&rsquo;s best known companies?</b></p><p>eBay is a well-known brand with extremely high awareness and is an admired brand &ndash;- we&rsquo;re #32 on Interbrand&rsquo;s 2016 list of best global brands &ndash; yet along with that comes some deeply-ingrained perceptions, many of them inaccurate. </p><p>People don&rsquo;t fully recognize we&rsquo;re more than the auction model, or we have new inventory, or we offer fast and free shipping and returns. There&rsquo;s a perception that we&rsquo;ve lost relevance and don&rsquo;t perform well on retail standards &ndash; yet our products and services have actually never been better. </p><p>Changing these perceptions is the number one job for the brand, and if we can do that, it will be in direct service of driving the business forward.  </p><p>The second thing we need to do is help attract the next 100 million buyers. To achieve this, brand is focused on establishing an emotional connection with current and new potential customers. There are many great examples out there of brands that do this well today and have taken a very contemporary approach&ndash; from Spotify&rsquo;s Year in Review, to Airbnb&rsquo;s focus on rich story-telling through engaging video. eBay has a huge opportunity to connect emotionally through more expected vehicles such as advertising, and thorough unexpected digital ones that combine data and storytelling as we reach new audiences. </p><p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s important that we really spark a movement. Dan Tarman and his team are doing an amazing job of helping to lead repositioning the brand from the inside out. We want that momentum to spill beyond our walls, beyond our website, and to really be part of a broader cultural movement.</p><p><b>Why are we doing this now?</b></p><p>There is an urgency and an imperative here. We have to drive consideration, relevance, and correct misconceptions around the brand, particularly as we reach new or reactivated buyers. In addition, as a company, we have an amazing history of innovation. We  set the stage for for the sharing economy.  We were at a forefront of online commerce. We were at the forefront of mobile. Now, we&rsquo;re on the verge of a new generation of technologies -- like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things. Our business can&rsquo;t afford to sit still, and let these next generation customers and platforms go by. We&rsquo;re industry leaders, and we have to build, accelerate and disrupt from a brand-led perspective to ensure long term relevance. </p><p><b>Right. So how is this different to previous brand rollouts?  </b></p><p>This isn&rsquo;t about an advertising campaign. It isn&rsquo;t about a logo change. It isn&rsquo;t about cosmetics, or graphic design systems. Brand today is about everything we do and say, and how we say and do it. At eBay, brand is rooted in our culture, it is aligned with our corporate strategy, and it bridges to our corporate ambition.  </p><p>For the first time, as a company, we&rsquo;re fully aligned on the brand strategy platform. It is supported by three pillars that will serve as a filter for anyone in the organization to understand how best to deliver on the brand, and help guide our colleagues as they create new ideas, product experiences and content. </p><p>Those pillars are:</p><p></p><ul><li><span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>A very clear vision of why we exist as a brand -- a vision that has alignment all the way up through all of our key leaders, our CEO, and right up to the Board of Directors</span><br></li><li><span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>A distinct set of brand traits that define how we personify our brand</span></li><li><span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>An agreed-upon set of propositions that we offer to buyers and sellers</span></li></ul><p></p><p><b>How is this all going to come to life for employees &ndash; particularly for those who don&rsquo;t work in marketing, who aren&rsquo;t immersed on a day-to-day level in this world. How we they see it, feel it and live it?</b></p><p>It is the employees who aren&rsquo;t in marketing who will be most critical to the long-term success of the brand. We need everything that people do to reinforce, not dilute, the brand. Whether it is the first 15 seconds of an onboarding experience, the moment when a new or reactivated buyer comes to check out eBay &ndash; those are dramatic and important brand-building touch points.  This is a massive opportunity that goes well beyond marketing.  It&rsquo;s rooted in the fulfillment of the promise. The experience. That&rsquo;s what I mean when I say this more than a campaign.</p><p><b>It seems brands are built in a much more holistic way today&hellip;</b></p><p>That&rsquo;s right. Brands are increasingly built through the experience, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important that the product team is strongly connected with the brand strategy and that the experience that delivers on it. </p><p>The other thing that&rsquo;s so different about the way brands are built today is that this is a social-led era, and our employees are the face of the brand -- whether on social or other channels. We need to have our army of advocates out there across social channels.  </p><p>We also need to inspire, assist and reward our existing and future customers through social media, through the product experience, as well as through hybrid digital and physical experiences. So today brands are built much more dynamically.</p><p>The whole idea of brand building was originally defensive, to protect your IP &ndash; in the very earliest days, it was about stamping your cattle with your brand.  Today, it&rsquo;s much more about the offensive.  It&rsquo;s about co-creating with our communities, opening up and being more transparent and more collaborative. To that end, I want employees to feel free to ask me questions directly, emailing me or even via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karlisimo\" target=\"_blank\">(@karlisimo</a>), as we open up and are more transparent as a brand.</p><p><b>Fast forward one year from now. What will success look like?</b></p><p>We will have made real gains in closing the perception gaps. We will have begun making gains in addressing the massive misunderstanding about our brand. Customers will have greater understanding of eBay and how we are different. And, we will be more relevant as a brand to millennials. </p><p>Longer term success will be measured by us bringing in the next generation of buyers, and having them become loyal customers, and our biggest advocates. It will also mean us behaving more confidently as a brand, and less reactively.</p><p>We are in the early innings here with the new brand strategy and brand playbook. And I&rsquo;m so&nbsp;<span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>excited about our opportunity ahead.

I&rsquo;ve had many diverse experiences in my career. Particularly for a Silicon Valley CEO, I find some value in the many experiences I&rsquo;ve had. Many Silicon Valley companies are run by their founders. </p><p>I&rsquo;ve learned from all of it. One of the things that I am proud of is taking on the challenge of successfully leading an Internet company after its founder.</p><p> </p><p><b>On advanced degrees:</b></p><p>There is nobody I have ever known who has had a career plan that&rsquo;s worked out. I say do what you love. When I went to law school I had no idea what I wanted to do. I spent a very brief time as an M&amp;A lawyer and I knew that was not what I wanted to do. People often constrain themselves early on, which is a shame. Many successful people tried different things.</p><p> </p><p><b>On eBay&rsquo;s strategy:</b></p><p>One of the unique things about eBay is its breadth of inventory. You can find things on eBay that you can&rsquo;t find anywhere else. We sell everything. We sell $95 billion a year. We&rsquo;ll sell you an iPhone and get it to you in three days. You can get a great deal on eBay.</p><p> </p><p>It has been important to me to make sure that eBay is not like anybody else. I don&rsquo;t want it to be like any other tech company or retailer. I want it to stand for something sharply different: the idea that you find your perfect on eBay. And this is not necessarily something you can walk into a store and buy. Maybe you want last year&rsquo;s version. I want to de-commoditize eBay.&nbsp;<span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>That&rsquo;s our strategy.</span></p><p> </p><p><b>On Mobile:</b></p><p>Mobile is half the business today and will be 100 percent in a few years. Mobile, for us, we were early and innovating. Everything we do now is mobile first. With VR, as seen here at Facebook, we are experimenting with it now. I don&rsquo;t even know what mobile means anymore when 50 percent of the business is mobile.</p><p> </p><p><b>Future of commerce:</b></p><p>Ultimately, commerce is about data and people. It&rsquo;s about connecting people and things and doing so in an authentic way. In the past 20 years, two big computing platform events shaped things. The Internet was one. And then there was mobile, which untethered people. I think that there are a couple more big platform revolutions shaping up. They are virtual reality, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.</p><p> </p><p>For commerce, these events will create  a highly personalized experience. You&rsquo;ll have immersive experiences, and consumers will have highly immersive buying experiences. If you look at the early days of mobile, you could see it but couldn&rsquo;t really understand how it was going to change the world. These new platforms I&rsquo;ve mentioned&hellip;they seem a little nerdy and techie, but we will wake up five years from now and say &ldquo;wow, virtual reality is not a toy, it&rsquo;s not just for gaming.&rdquo; Commerce will be an early implementation of VR.</p><p> </p><p><b>Treasures bought or sold on eBay:</b></p><p>When I moved from NY to Silicon Valley, I sold my ties. This was metaphorical, but I got a great price. I also bought 1880s maps of San Francisco and New York, my two home towns. And I bought a 1997 Land Rover Defender which I drive on weekends. My wife hates it.</p><p> </p><p><b>On diversity and inclusion:</b></p><p>Here&rsquo;s why this is important. To me it&rsquo;s not a social issue. I&rsquo;m the CEO of eBay and I don&rsquo;t want to champion diversity and inclusion as a social matter but rather because I believe we&rsquo;ll be the best business we can be through diversity. One example reason is that I have 160 million customers and they are not all white men in Silicon Valley. We need to reflect diversity in our management and around the company or we are not going to understand our customers.</p><p> </p><p>Secondly, in a tech business you&rsquo;re in a constant war for talent. I want an environment where, women, for instance, don&rsquo;t believe they have to give up their best selves to come to eBay. We were early to publish our gender diversity data. In October we are publishing probably the most detailed study in technology on pay and pay equity across all our ranks. Two months ago we hired our first Chief Diversity Officer, who is remarkable. He thinks about diversity not just from a metrics standpoint, but in terms of how eBay can be relevant in, say, inner cities, in helping African Americans become entrepreneurs.&nbsp;<span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5;'>For me this is all very important, and how eBay becomes its best self.</span></p><p class=\"\"><br></p></div> </div> </div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>\n",

In Shanghai, they held an <a href=\"https://hubtv.corp.ebay.com/video/67935.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">All-Hands</a>&nbsp;with 600 eBay employees, and the China team organized a product showcase (shown above)&nbsp;for them to help them better understand what types of products Chinese sellers sell on eBay.</p><p>The showcase featured examples of typical inventory from Chinese sellers on eBay spanning all categories on the site. Examples of the most popular items include products with a low average selling price (ASP) like cell phone cases, t-shirts, etc, as well as items with a higher ASP like smartphones, drones, and virtual reality equipment.</p><p>&ldquo;Traditionally, Chinese sellers sell light-weight items that are easily shipped from China to different countries,&rdquo; said John Lin, Vice President of eBay Greater China, &ldquo;in recent years, large sellers are establishing warehouses in different markets to hold inventory, and this has enabled them to ship products to buyers directly from the local market, thus greatly improving the buyer experience.  Warehouses also make it possible for sellers to sell heavier, bulkier, and higher ASP products.&rdquo;</p><p>Paul Todd, Senior Vice President of eBay Europe, said &ldquo;European customers love Chinese sellers&rsquo; products. The products deployed in European warehouses delivered much better user experiences than several years ago.&rdquo;</p><p>As a group, the ELT visits China about once every two years, and this was one of four trips that they make annually to different non-US based sites. Typically, said Hal, the visits are a mix of meetings with the local teams, operating reviews, and strategy sessions.</p><p>This time around, in addition to the product showcase, the leadership team took some time during the week to meet with Chinese sellers in Shenzhen.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely happy to host the leadership team, and our sellers also appreciate the opportunity to have face to face meeting with our executives.

Examples of the most popular items include products with a low average selling price (ASP) like cell phone cases, t-shirts, etc, as well as items with a higher ASP like smartphones, drones, and virtual reality equipment.</p><p>&ldquo;Traditionally, Chinese sellers sell light-weight items that are easily shipped from China to different countries,&rdquo; said John Lin, Vice President of eBay Greater China, &ldquo;in recent years, large sellers are establishing warehouses in different markets to hold inventory, and this has enabled them to ship products to buyers directly from the local market, thus greatly improving the buyer experience.  Warehouses also make it possible for sellers to sell heavier, bulkier, and higher ASP products.&rdquo;</p><p>Paul Todd, Senior Vice President of eBay Europe, said &ldquo;European customers love Chinese sellers&rsquo; products. The products deployed in European warehouses delivered much better user experiences than several years ago.&rdquo;</p><p>As a group, the ELT visits China about once every two years, and this was one of four trips that they make annually to different non-US based sites. Typically, said Hal, the visits are a mix of meetings with the local teams, operating reviews, and strategy sessions.</p><p>This time around, in addition to the product showcase, the leadership team took some time during the week to meet with Chinese sellers in Shenzhen.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re extremely happy to host the leadership team, and our sellers also appreciate the opportunity to have face to face meeting with our executives. The CBT team in China is committed to bringing in more wanted inventory to meet the needs to global shoppers,&rdquo; added John Lin.</p></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",
