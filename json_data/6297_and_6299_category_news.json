Using our data, we&rsquo;re also increasingly reaching out to our seller base to prompt them to source and list in-demand goods where we see gaps in supply.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In the last few months we have launched new curated experiences in Fashion and Home &amp; Garden.

Externally, you&rsquo;ll really begin to see the brand come to life during the Holiday season, including returning to TV advertising in Europe and the U.S. -- the first time we&rsquo;ve done so during Holiday since 2014. Changing our brand is a long-term undertaking, and we&rsquo;ll continue to ramp these efforts into 2017.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">StubHub continues to innovate and execute amidst a large and increasingly global market opportunity. The team is driving innovative and cool user experiences, expanding our virtual reality technology to 55 total venues &ndash; which represents over a third of ticket sales on our native app platform.

Our pace of innovation is accelerating, including the use of structured data and artificial intelligence to transform the shopping experience on eBay.

(NASDAQ: EBAY), a global commerce leader, delivered gross merchandise volume (GMV) for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 of $20.1 billion, increasing 5% on a foreign exchange (FX) neutral basis and 3% on an as-reported basis. Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, up 8% on an FX-Neutral basis and 6% on an as-reported basis. GAAP net income from continuing operations was $418 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $509 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. During the quarter, the company generated $802 million of operating cash flow and $617 million of free cash flow from continuing operations while also repurchasing $500 million of its common stock.</p><p>&ldquo;In Q3 we delivered good top- and bottom-line financial results, led by consistent performance across our business,&rdquo; said Devin Wenig, President and CEO of eBay Inc. &ldquo;We continued to transform the shopping experience on eBay, delivered more personalization capabilities and began to activate our updated brand messaging.&rdquo;</p><p>In the third quarter, eBay added over one million active buyers across its platforms, to a total of 165 million global active buyers. Underlying total eBay Inc. performance, the Marketplace platforms delivered $19.0 billion of GMV and $1.8 billion of revenue. Marketplace revenue was up 5% on an FX-Neutral basis and 2% on an as-reported basis, driven by GMV growth of 4% on an FX-Neutral basis and 2% on an as-reported basis as well as growth in Marketing Services &amp; Other revenue. StubHub had another strong quarter with GMV of $1.1 billion, up 23%, and revenue of $263 million, up 32%, aided by strength across concerts, theater and baseball as well as the continued benefit from ongoing product innovation. The Classifieds platforms delivered another quarter of good performance with revenue of $197 million, up 14% on an FX-Neutral basis and 11% on an as-reported basis, primarily driven by the Automotive and Real Estate verticals across several key geographies.</p><p>eBay made progress during the quarter in driving the most relevant shopping experiences for consumers. Marketplace delivered further enhancements to its mobile platform and introduced Quick Sale, a targeted consumer destination for selling mobile phones. The company also began to activate an updated strategy for the eBay brand and was recently ranked as number 32 in Interbrand&rsquo;s Best Global Brands 2016 report. StubHub continued to drive innovation, expanding its virtual reality technology to more venues in the United States, as well as launching a blended primary and secondary tickets experience with the Philadelphia 76ers. Classifieds began integrating tickets inventory from StubHub in Canada, while furthering efforts to integrate inventory from eBay in several markets.</p><p>eBay continues to be acquisitive in the areas of geographic and vertical expansion, and adding key technology and talent. Most recently, it announced an agreement to purchase Corrigon Ltd., a pioneer of visual search technologies, expected to contribute to the Marketplace platform's structured data initiative. In addition to its recent strategic acquisitions, eBay has returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2016 in the form of share repurchases. eBay also recently sold most of its stake in MercadoLibre, Inc. The sale enables eBay to realize a significant gain on its investment, and the company intends to use the net proceeds in a manner consistent with its capital allocation policy.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-reports-third-quarter-2016-results/\" target=\"_blank\">See our full press release here.</a></p></div>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>\n",

Revenue for the quarter was $2.2 billion, up 8% on an FX-Neutral basis and 6% on an as-reported basis. GAAP net income from continuing operations was $418 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, and non-GAAP net income from continuing operations was $509 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. During the quarter, the company generated $802 million of operating cash flow and $617 million of free cash flow from continuing operations while also repurchasing $500 million of its common stock.</p><p>&ldquo;In Q3 we delivered good top- and bottom-line financial results, led by consistent performance across our business,&rdquo; said Devin Wenig, President and CEO of eBay Inc. &ldquo;We continued to transform the shopping experience on eBay, delivered more personalization capabilities and began to activate our updated brand messaging.&rdquo;</p><p>In the third quarter, eBay added over one million active buyers across its platforms, to a total of 165 million global active buyers. Underlying total eBay Inc. performance, the Marketplace platforms delivered $19.0 billion of GMV and $1.8 billion of revenue. Marketplace revenue was up 5% on an FX-Neutral basis and 2% on an as-reported basis, driven by GMV growth of 4% on an FX-Neutral basis and 2% on an as-reported basis as well as growth in Marketing Services &amp; Other revenue. StubHub had another strong quarter with GMV of $1.1 billion, up 23%, and revenue of $263 million, up 32%, aided by strength across concerts, theater and baseball as well as the continued benefit from ongoing product innovation. The Classifieds platforms delivered another quarter of good performance with revenue of $197 million, up 14% on an FX-Neutral basis and 11% on an as-reported basis, primarily driven by the Automotive and Real Estate verticals across several key geographies.</p><p>eBay made progress during the quarter in driving the most relevant shopping experiences for consumers. Marketplace delivered further enhancements to its mobile platform and introduced Quick Sale, a targeted consumer destination for selling mobile phones. The company also began to activate an updated strategy for the eBay brand and was recently ranked as number 32 in Interbrand&rsquo;s Best Global Brands 2016 report. StubHub continued to drive innovation, expanding its virtual reality technology to more venues in the United States, as well as launching a blended primary and secondary tickets experience with the Philadelphia 76ers. Classifieds began integrating tickets inventory from StubHub in Canada, while furthering efforts to integrate inventory from eBay in several markets.</p><p>eBay continues to be acquisitive in the areas of geographic and vertical expansion, and adding key technology and talent. Most recently, it announced an agreement to purchase Corrigon Ltd., a pioneer of visual search technologies, expected to contribute to the Marketplace platform's structured data initiative. In addition to its recent strategic acquisitions, eBay has returned $2 billion of capital to shareholders in 2016 in the form of share repurchases. eBay also recently sold most of its stake in MercadoLibre, Inc. The sale enables eBay to realize a significant gain on its investment, and the company intends to use the net proceeds in a manner consistent with its capital allocation policy.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/ebay-inc-reports-third-quarter-2016-results/\" target=\"_blank\">See our full press release here.</a></p></div>\n</div>\n</div>",

And our people: There is a fighting spirit that is uniquely eBay, that allows us to do amazing things together at exceptional scale.&rdquo;</p><p>Asked what inspires her, Laura said it was our customers. &ldquo;They need us to do brilliant work on their behalf, so that they can keep their mortgages paid, or their staff employed, or be able to afford that one unique thing that would otherwise be out of reach.&rdquo;</p><p>Two leaders &ndash; one female and one male -- will be selected to receive the award annually until 2020. The honorees will receive a mentoring session with Devin Wenig, John Donahoe and another leader of their choice. They will also be given the opportunity to attend a Stanford University Executive Education course to further develop their leadership skills and capabilities, and to help position them to drive each company forward, through 2020 and beyond.</p></div> </div> </div> </div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

Brand is an approach and a way of thinking that is integral to a company&rsquo;s vision, strategy and culture. The most effective brands are those which inspire an emotional connection in the hearts and minds of employees and consumers.</i></p><p><i>Earlier this year, we welcomed Karl Isaac as our new Vice President of Global Brand. In his previous role at Adobe, Karl led the brand through a period of bold change in business, product, and brand strategy </i><i>that created significant brand value, accelerated relevance globally, and established a strong emotional connection with its</i>&nbsp;<i>community.</i></p><p><i>Now, he brings his expertise to eBay, where he leads the Brand team, and has - in partnership with </i><i>senior </i><i>leaders from across the business and around the world </i><i>- overseen the development of eBay&rsquo;s new brand strategy platform, encompassing the vision, traits, and propositions to buyers and sellers.</i></p><p><i>Together, the group has aligned around a strong and differentiated brand strategy platform that centers on why eBay exists as a brand: <b>to help every person get their version of perfect, no matter what it is.</b></i><i> </i><i></i></p><p><i>During the remainder of 2016, you&rsquo;ll see the brand beginning to be activated across the company. </i><i>Starting as early as next week, the Brand team will begin a roadshow in Europe and then North America and APAC to roll out the first version of the new Brand Playbook, with additional updates to follow throughout the year.</i></p><p><i>Ahead of that, Karl sat down with <b>Jennifer O&rsquo;Connell</b> and <b>Tobias Huebscher</b> of the Hub News Team to share some of what&rsquo;s been happening behind the scenes &ndash; and what&rsquo;s coming next &ndash; for our brand, and to talk about what it means to create, build and guide eBay&rsquo;s brand in 2016 and beyond.</i></p><p><b>What do we mean when we talk about &lsquo;brand repositioning&rsquo;? And why does eBay need to worry about brand &ndash; after all, we&rsquo;re one of the world&rsquo;s best known companies?</b></p><p>eBay is a well-known brand with extremely high awareness and is an admired brand &ndash;- we&rsquo;re #32 on Interbrand&rsquo;s 2016 list of best global brands &ndash; yet along with that comes some deeply-ingrained perceptions, many of them inaccurate. </p><p>People don&rsquo;t fully recognize we&rsquo;re more than the auction model, or we have new inventory, or we offer fast and free shipping and returns. There&rsquo;s a perception that we&rsquo;ve lost relevance and don&rsquo;t perform well on retail standards &ndash; yet our products and services have actually never been better. </p><p>Changing these perceptions is the number one job for the brand, and if we can do that, it will be in direct service of driving the business forward.  </p><p>The second thing we need to do is help attract the next 100 million buyers. To achieve this, brand is focused on establishing an emotional connection with current and new potential customers. There are many great examples out there of brands that do this well today and have taken a very contemporary approach&ndash; from Spotify&rsquo;s Year in Review, to Airbnb&rsquo;s focus on rich story-telling through engaging video. eBay has a huge opportunity to connect emotionally through more expected vehicles such as advertising, and thorough unexpected digital ones that combine data and storytelling as we reach new audiences. </p><p>Lastly, it&rsquo;s important that we really spark a movement. Dan Tarman and his team are doing an amazing job of helping to lead repositioning the brand from the inside out. We want that momentum to spill beyond our walls, beyond our website, and to really be part of a broader cultural movement.</p><p><b>Why are we doing this now?</b></p><p>There is an urgency and an imperative here. We have to drive consideration, relevance, and correct misconceptions around the brand, particularly as we reach new or reactivated buyers. In addition, as a company, we have an amazing history of innovation. We  set the stage for for the sharing economy.  We were at a forefront of online commerce. We were at the forefront of mobile. Now, we&rsquo;re on the verge of a new generation of technologies -- like artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the Internet of Things. Our business can&rsquo;t afford to sit still, and let these next generation customers and platforms go by. We&rsquo;re industry leaders, and we have to build, accelerate and disrupt from a brand-led perspective to ensure long term relevance. </p><p><b>Right. So how is this different to previous brand rollouts?  </b></p><p>This isn&rsquo;t about an advertising campaign. It isn&rsquo;t about a logo change. It isn&rsquo;t about cosmetics, or graphic design systems. Brand today is about everything we do and say, and how we say and do it. At eBay, brand is rooted in our culture, it is aligned with our corporate strategy, and it bridges to our corporate ambition.  </p><p>For the first time, as a company, we&rsquo;re fully aligned on the brand strategy platform. It is supported by three pillars that will serve as a filter for anyone in the organization to understand how best to deliver on the brand, and help guide our colleagues as they create new ideas, product experiences and content. </p><p>Those pillars are:</p><p></p><ul><li><span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>A very clear vision of why we exist as a brand -- a vision that has alignment all the way up through all of our key leaders, our CEO, and right up to the Board of Directors</span><br></li><li><span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>A distinct set of brand traits that define how we personify our brand</span></li><li><span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>An agreed-upon set of propositions that we offer to buyers and sellers</span></li></ul><p></p><p><b>How is this all going to come to life for employees &ndash; particularly for those who don&rsquo;t work in marketing, who aren&rsquo;t immersed on a day-to-day level in this world. How we they see it, feel it and live it?</b></p><p>It is the employees who aren&rsquo;t in marketing who will be most critical to the long-term success of the brand. We need everything that people do to reinforce, not dilute, the brand. Whether it is the first 15 seconds of an onboarding experience, the moment when a new or reactivated buyer comes to check out eBay &ndash; those are dramatic and important brand-building touch points.  This is a massive opportunity that goes well beyond marketing.  It&rsquo;s rooted in the fulfillment of the promise. The experience. That&rsquo;s what I mean when I say this more than a campaign.</p><p><b>It seems brands are built in a much more holistic way today&hellip;</b></p><p>That&rsquo;s right. Brands are increasingly built through the experience, and that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s so important that the product team is strongly connected with the brand strategy and that the experience that delivers on it. </p><p>The other thing that&rsquo;s so different about the way brands are built today is that this is a social-led era, and our employees are the face of the brand -- whether on social or other channels. We need to have our army of advocates out there across social channels.  </p><p>We also need to inspire, assist and reward our existing and future customers through social media, through the product experience, as well as through hybrid digital and physical experiences. So today brands are built much more dynamically.</p><p>The whole idea of brand building was originally defensive, to protect your IP &ndash; in the very earliest days, it was about stamping your cattle with your brand.  Today, it&rsquo;s much more about the offensive.  It&rsquo;s about co-creating with our communities, opening up and being more transparent and more collaborative. To that end, I want employees to feel free to ask me questions directly, emailing me or even via Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karlisimo\" target=\"_blank\">(@karlisimo</a>), as we open up and are more transparent as a brand.</p><p><b>Fast forward one year from now. What will success look like?</b></p><p>We will have made real gains in closing the perception gaps. We will have begun making gains in addressing the massive misunderstanding about our brand. Customers will have greater understanding of eBay and how we are different. And, we will be more relevant as a brand to millennials. </p><p>Longer term success will be measured by us bringing in the next generation of buyers, and having them become loyal customers, and our biggest advocates. It will also mean us behaving more confidently as a brand, and less reactively.</p><p>We are in the early innings here with the new brand strategy and brand playbook. And I&rsquo;m so&nbsp;<span style='color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-size: 1.125rem; letter-spacing: -0.2px; line-height: 1.5; font-family: \"Helvetica Neue\", Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;'>excited about our opportunity ahead.
