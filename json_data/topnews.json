With a background in community engagement and experience leading diversity efforts at several top technology companies, Damien is tasked with creating and expanding programs that foster a more inclusive culture at eBay and across its online marketplace.</p><p>Get to know Damien before he joins us at AfroTech this November, and read our interview with him below:</p><p><strong>Blavity:</strong> There has been much debate and discussion of the state of diversity in tech. Can you talk about what you&rsquo;ve seen in the Valley over the past few years?</p><p><strong>Damien Hooper-Campbell:</strong> The tech industry is getting a bad rap right now. But from my vantage point, it&rsquo;s actually a huge opportunity to change the narrative. From the time I&rsquo;ve spent inside companies like Google and eBay, I&rsquo;ve realized that tech is actually very serious about diversity &ndash; both from an investment and a &ldquo;this makes good business sense&rdquo; standpoint.</p><p>If there&rsquo;s any industry that can have a real shot at moving the needle, it&rsquo;s technology. The industry has the five key ingredients that I feel are absolutely critical to making meaningful change:</p><ul><li>First, you need a culture of innovation. Continuous innovation and improvement are the lifeblood of the technology industry.  Challenges in diversity an inclusion in tech didn&rsquo;t happen overnight &ndash; they are the result of a long history of social structure and culture issues in our world. As a result, they won&rsquo;t change overnight and won&rsquo;t change without some truly innovative mindsets and courageous and honest ideas;</li><li>Second, you need capital to invest in materializing those innovative ideas and building out the teams to lead those efforts.  And tech was among the top four cash-heavy US industries in 2016;</li><li>Third, you need a visible problem.  If you&rsquo;ve ever walked through the offices of technology companies in the Valley, you can&rsquo;t help but notice a lack of diversity for the aspects of diversity that are visible.</li><li>Finally, you need leaders who are willing to acknowledge, understand and address the issue. eBay&rsquo;s CEO, Devin Wenig, and his leadership team are committed to driving sustainable organizational and cultural change around diversity.  They are willing to acknowledge the uncomfortable and sticky problems and push the envelope to address them, and that&rsquo;s exciting for me.  More important, they know that making impact in this area takes time.  That was made really clear when I originally interviewed with the company and is one of the main reasons why I decided to join the eBay family.</li></ul><p><strong>B:</strong> What do you say to the non-believers about why diversity is important in a corporate context, and more specifically in a tech context?</p><p>I&rsquo;d say that the benefit to looking at diversity in a corporate context goes way beyond recruitment and aspirational hiring goals; it&rsquo;s also a means developing and retaining the talent you currently have and focusing on create an inclusive environment for everyone inside of the company. As Tech leaders, we must continue to be deliberate about identifying and highlighting examples of how diversity and inclusion can help to drive the bottom line. Diversifying your workforce is always the right thing to do &ndash; not only from a human standpoint, but also from a productivity standpoint. Sure &ndash; best ideas win in our companies &ndash; but are we sure we have all of the best ideas even at the table to be heard?</p><p><strong>B:</strong> We&rsquo;ve heard businesses talk a lot about efforts to diversify the workplace, but we aren&rsquo;t seeing a ton of results. How do you drive meaningful change? How do you translate words into meaningful actions?</p><p><strong>DHC:</strong> First, I wouldn&rsquo;t say that we aren&rsquo;t seeing a ton of results &ndash; I think it just depends on how we define &ldquo;results&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;results&rdquo; is defined as the percentage of underrepresented employees at a company year over year, then sure &ndash; we aren&rsquo;t seeing huge gains.  But should that be the only metric we evaluate?  What about innovative programs that are pushing the envelope on how we engage communities? What about the empowerment of Employee Resource Groups to get started for the first time in a company&rsquo;s history &ndash; and the ability of those groups to create &ldquo;safe spaces&rdquo; for people to discuss topics meaningful to certain communities?  What about the products and marketing strategies that are inclusive of underrepresented populations for the first time in a company&rsquo;s history?  What about the partnerships that help to support incredible entrepreneurs like those who founded Blavity?</p><p>I guess my point is that we have become obsessed with defining &ldquo;results&rdquo; almost myopically through the annual diversity data releases that we read.  I think that&rsquo;s an oversight &ndash; driving an increase in representation incorporates so many factors that go beyond how many recruiters a company has focused on diversity hiring.  As mentioned before, this isn&rsquo;t an overnight strategy &ndash; it&rsquo;s not an app-based solution that you just develop overnight and launch.  It&rsquo;s complex, way more than representation numbers and will take well beyond a year-over-year measurement to see widescale impact.</p><p>Let me be clear, numbers are very important &ndash; but they are only one measure and will take more than 365 days to truly impact. Let&rsquo;s begin to adopt and acknowledge a much broader definition of what &ldquo;results&rdquo; should mean.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> We understand you joined eBay a few months ago. Tell us about your current role at the company.</p><p><strong>DHC:</strong> I am blessed to be eBay&rsquo;s first Chief Diversity Officer. In my role, I am responsible for ensuring that we influence our people and processes to infuse a diversity and inclusion lens across several areas:</p><ol><li>Our workforce &ndash; how we think about hiring, what define as a &ldquo;successful&rdquo; profile, the schools we go to for recruiting and the processes we undertake when evaluating potential employees.</li><li>Our workplace &ndash; how we feel when we&rsquo;re at eBay. To be clear, diversity and inclusion for us goes well beyond gender and race. It obviously includes those two things, but it also focuses on how people think, on introverts vs. extroverts, on generational differences, on the fact that we are a Silicon Valley- and US-based organization but have offices all over the world &ndash; how do we ensure those offices feel represented at HQ. Inclusion for us is not just focused on under-represented minorities and women, it&rsquo;s also about making sure that majority stakeholder feel included and safe in the conversations that are often tough to have.</li><li>Our marketplace &ndash; how we embed diversity and inclusion in everything that we&rsquo;re doing as we think about our buyers and sellers around the world. Because eBay doesn&rsquo;t thrive as a company if we continue to have the same profiles of buyers and sellers; we have to expand that profile and continue to be more inclusive.</li></ol><p><strong>B:</strong> Tell us about your career journey and what led you to join eBay?</p><p><strong>DHC:</strong> For me, getting to this point has boiled down to five things &ndash; faith, personal experiences, an amazing mother, incredible mentors and a little bit of luck. I grew up in environments that were very racially polarizing &ndash; from Chicago&rsquo;s Southside to Connecticut&rsquo;s Fairfield County, from a Historically Black College to studying abroad in Southern Spain. I have a diverse family from race and nationality to education and socio-economic group. All of these experiences are ones that, over time, have forced me to expand how I view the world.</p><p>I never set out to be a Chief Diversity Officer, and until a few years or so ago, I didn&rsquo;t even know this role existed. Throughout my careers in finance, nonprofit, academia and HR, I&rsquo;ve maintained a passion for helping people and fighting for equality. A few years ago, I got a call from Google asking to join their boundary-pushing diversity team. To be honest, I was initially hesitant as I was jaded by experiences with companies who paid lipservice to diversity and inclusion, but weren&rsquo;t really serious about it. However, the more I talked with people at Google and learned about the tech industry, I realized that companies like Google and eBay are very serious about driving change in this space.</p><p>I made the decision to come to eBay for a number of reasons.</p><ul><li>First, I was blown away by what I heard from the senior-most leaders at the company &ndash; starting with our CEO. This role was not only created by our CEO, but he made it clear that this wasn&rsquo;t some &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll hire you and that will keep the rest of the leaders at eBay from having to be visible on this topic&rdquo; situation. Instead, he and the other senior leaders committed to joining me in being out in front on this issue.  </li><li>Second, diversity and inclusion is one of eBay&rsquo;s founding principles as it&rsquo;s the backbone of our business model. eBay is about connecting people from all over the world, and it has used technology to help countless entrepreneurs from all backgrounds start and grow businesses and gain economic empowerment.</li><li>Finally, the people &ndash; I&rsquo;d heard that eBay had some of the smartest and low-ego people in Tech and I&rsquo;ve found that to be absolutely true.  Not only is eBay full of genuinely good people, but there is an incredible demand from our people across the globe to learn, contribute and lead when it comes to diversity and inclusion.  </li></ul><p><strong>B:</strong> You&rsquo;ve worked with a ton of big name companies. What are some career lessons you&rsquo;ve picked up along the way?</p><p><strong>DHC:</strong> Wow.  Where do I start?  Feedback is a gift. Direct and honest feedback is a gift that you will hopefully receive, but it is even more important when you give it. Most of my growth moments have come from receiving the toughest feedback. We have a responsibility to make each other better.</p><p>Also, invest in yourself. I am very passionate about mentorship. Early in my career, I was pouring more into others than I was giving to myself. I wondered, had I invested in myself as much as I&rsquo;d invested in others? Just like on an airplane when the flight attendant says, &ldquo;put on your oxygen mask before helping the person next to you,&rdquo; you need to invest in yourself and look out for yourself in order to be better for you and others.</p><p>Finally, find something or someone that anchors you and helps you to keep perspective.  For me, it&rsquo;s my faith in God &ndash; something my grandparents and mother instilled in me from a young age.  It&rsquo;s made me humble and helped me to realize that there is a source of power and direction that goes beyond what I can understand.  Especially during tough times, my faith has been my rock.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> What advice would you give students and young professionals beginning to explore and start their own careers? </p><p><strong>DHC:</strong> Be patient. Very few of us are lucky enough to find what we are passionate about at an early stage. This beautiful world tries to force us to decide early &ndash; whether by major, what you want to be when you grow up, etc.  But you need to be patient. Try to block out the noise and don&rsquo;t worry about following the herd. The quicker you can get to a place of self-awareness, the better off you will be. It may feel very uncomfortable in the near-term, but maintaining conviction in what is true to you will catapult you forward in the long-run.  And, whatever you do, try to be exceptional at it.</p></div>\n</div></body></html>\n",

For me, it&rsquo;s my faith in God &ndash; something my grandparents and mother instilled in me from a young age.  It&rsquo;s made me humble and helped me to realize that there is a source of power and direction that goes beyond what I can understand.  Especially during tough times, my faith has been my rock.</p><p><strong>B:</strong> What advice would you give students and young professionals beginning to explore and start their own careers? </p><p><strong>DHC:</strong> Be patient. Very few of us are lucky enough to find what we are passionate about at an early stage. This beautiful world tries to force us to decide early &ndash; whether by major, what you want to be when you grow up, etc.  But you need to be patient. Try to block out the noise and don&rsquo;t worry about following the herd. The quicker you can get to a place of self-awareness, the better off you will be. It may feel very uncomfortable in the near-term, but maintaining conviction in what is true to you will catapult you forward in the long-run.  And, whatever you do, try to be exceptional at it.</p></div>\n</div>",

Bhadouria shared that in the early days of Girl Geek Dinner, &ldquo;the first two people that liked the Facebook posts were Angie&rsquo;s mom and my mom &ndash; from India and Taiwan &ndash; we were already international!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>eBay&rsquo;s Chief Diversity Officer, Damien Hooper-Campbell, set the tone by discussing what he called &ldquo;Breaking Conventionalism,&rdquo; and how diversity and inclusion &ndash; both of which power innovation &ndash; are critical to eBay and its continued business success.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\"For the rest of the evening and throughout your involvement with Girl Geek, I encourage you to leave your representatives at the door and fast-forward to viewing each other as family. Tonight, let's push beyond the typical, surface-level conversation so we can leave with beyond surface level ideas and takeaways,&rdquo; Damien said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He told the story of how he broke convention with his career &ndash; leaving Wall Street at Goldman Sachs to tackle diversity and inclusion in the tech industry. He explained how his mother broke convention and raised him as a single-parent, working on Wall Street as a black woman in the 1980s to send him to a good school. He drew attention to his great-grandfather who moved to the north as part of the Great Migration in the 1920s and marched on Washington. And he spoke of his great aunt, who broke definitions of what it meant to be a woman in Guyana in the 1940s by being head of household and owning property.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted this to be personal tonight,&rdquo; Damien said, &ldquo;I wanted you to understand more about why I&rsquo;ve dedicated my life to breaking convention.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Damien&rsquo;s sotry set the stage for a panel discussion featuring several eBay leaders including Kelly Vincent, VP of Consumer Selling Product Management and Engineering; Mrinalini Loew, Senior Director of Mobile &amp; Accessibility; Maliena Guy, Product Manager, Search; and Connie Yang, Software Engineer, Data Infrastructure, U.S. Moderated by Laura Chambers, VP of Consumer to Consumer Selling, the panel explored themes of fulfillment, the importance of being a role model, cultivating a support system, and of course, breaking convention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kelly Vincent shared a story about a seller whose husband had left her, making her feel completely lost and scared given her lack of work experience. The seller decided to start selling jewelry on eBay and was eventually able to fully support herself and her children through her business. &ldquo;I realized what a direct, immense impact we can have on people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; Kelly reflected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mrinalini Loew explained that she is able to fuel the passion that brings her into work every day and how she has a &ldquo;tribe&rdquo; of peers and mentors around her that help her whether they know it or not. &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m really proud of is that I don&rsquo;t have a single tribe &ndash; I really rely on so many tribes&hellip; we have our little family tribe&hellip; I also have my tribes at work. I&rsquo;ve had a peer tribe at every single company I&rsquo;ve worked at&hellip; I also have a tribe of women who don&rsquo;t even know that they&rsquo;re my tribe of &ldquo;inspirers.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maliena Guy shared that when she first started the CS program at UC Berkeley, there were 400 people in her class &ndash; a fraction of whom were women. By contrast, now her younger sister is at UC Berkeley in that same CS class, and there are now 1,200 people, nearly half of whom are women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connie Yang recounted the time her son told her that he was interested in robotics. Realizing there was no robotics program in place at his school, Connie fielded a flagship program with local parents in the community &ndash; teaching Python, Java and other programs to their kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>eBay&rsquo;s Girl Geek Dinner created an environment in which every individual &ndash; presenter, panelist or audience member &ndash; was inspired to not only share their own stories, but to share the stories of the convention breakers in their lives. This is part of eBay&rsquo;s approach to breaking conventions in how we approach diversity and inclusion. Instead of rolling out a strategy with lectures and trainings, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re starting with a conversation,&rdquo; Damien explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Continuing the organization&rsquo;s mission, eBay&rsquo;s Girl Geek Dinner aimed to establish a lasting circle of trust, encouraging a cycle of convention breakers, and inspiring attendees to take the lessons they learned and give back wherever possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All proceeds of the dinner went towards <a href=\"https://hackbrightacademy.com/scholarships/\" target=\"_blank\">need-based scholarships for women</a> to learn to code at <a href=\"https://hackbrightacademy.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hackbright Academy</a>, an engineering school for women.</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"medium-insert-images medium-insert-images-grid\">\r\n<figure contenteditable=\"false\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/AU8D9634.jpg\"></figure><figure contenteditable=\"false\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/AU8D9547.jpg\"></figure><figure contenteditable=\"false\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/306A3450.jpg\"></figure><figure contenteditable=\"false\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/306A3340.jpg\"></figure><figure contenteditable=\"false\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/306A3318.jpg\"></figure><figure contenteditable=\"false\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/AU8D9660_0.jpg\"></figure></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div></body></html>\n",

Please enjoy the photo story below, recapping an outstanding evening.</p><div class=\"medium-insert-images\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/Orchard%20Diwali%20Committee%5B1%5D_0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><p class=\"medium-insert-active\"></p><p class=\"\"></p><img src=\"/sites/default/files/WT8A8414.jpg\" alt=\"\"><p></p><div class=\"medium-insert-images\"> &nbsp; <img src=\"/sites/default/files/WT8A8407.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><div class=\"medium-insert-images\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/WT8A8524.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><p class=\"\"></p></div>\n</div>",

Star Wars&rsquo; BB-8 flew off the  virtual shelves. Frozen commanded everyone&rsquo;s attention before that.  Tablets, smartphones and fitness trackers have headlined recent  holidays, all no-brainer gift ideas that removed the decision-making  burden for last minute shoppers.</span></p><p>With the holidays upon us,  retailers have been stocking their shelves &ndash; both virtual and real &ndash;  with everything from toys to clothes to smartphones to smart fitness  trackers.</p><p>However, today&rsquo;s reality is that people have more choice  and more ways to shop than ever before, but far less time. It has  become harder than ever for them to find the perfect gifts that fit  their budgets.  </p><p>Last year, about two-thirds of Americans gave up  on finding the perfect gift for someone due to lack of time or  inspiration, according to eBay&rsquo;s 2016 Holiday Survey of U.S. consumers.  Also, 81 percent of those surveyed agree that finding the perfect gift  becomes more difficult every year. Of this group, parents (90 percent)  and millennials (91 percent), in particular, said they were unable to  find the right gift.</p><p>This year we may see the smart shopper  splitting from the crowd and choosing personalized items based on the  gift-receiver&rsquo;s tastes.  </p><p><strong>A Stretched Holiday Season With An Election Thrown In</strong></p><p>The  online shopping scene is continuing to grow and evolve. This year, more  than half of the U.S population is expected to shop online, according  to Forrester Research. This is not a surprise.</p><p>I saw notable  buying trends last year as eBay fulfilled 265 million transactions  across 190 markets on great deals and gifts over the holidays. About  half of the transactions came from mobile devices. For the big four  shopping days beginning on Thanksgiving through Sunday, Nov. 29, our  mobile Gross Merchandise Bought share increased, on average, 12 percent  year-over-year.</p><p>We expect many of these trends to continue this  season. Likely more people will be shopping on mobile, and most will  still look for bigger and better deals. We know that Black Friday and  Cyber Monday are again going to be huge shopping days, and the debate  over which one is bigger will continue.</p><p>The biggest difference  this year is that the holiday season is longer. Historically, retailers  have kicked off the season the day after Halloween. But consumers are  more distracted now because of the U.S. Presidential election.</p><p>Most  retailers are expected to launch their holiday plans following the  election. Meanwhile, we have Thanksgiving falling earlier in November  than last year. All in all as compared to last year, we have a  compressed pre-holiday shopping season between election and  Thanksgiving, but a longer period of shopping time from Thanksgiving to  Christmas.</p><p>Many forecasters expect that if the election goes as  predicted, we will see a two to three  percent lift in holiday sales  overall, compared to last year.</p><p><strong>Hatchimals? Looking Beyond Hot Trends</strong></p><p>This  holiday season, no single standout gift has emerged, which represents a  significant departure from past seasons. Since shoppers aren&rsquo;t  clamoring for a specific must-have item there&rsquo;s actually more pressure  to find perfect gifts. </p><p>There are &ndash; and will always be  -- some,  trending hot items. For instance, there are toy maker Mattel&rsquo;s Barbie  doll houses with bluetooth remotes for lights and music; Hatchimals from  Spin Master; gaming consoles; virtual reality devices; drones and  seasonal clothing are already on their way to the top of the charts.  Then there is the upcoming release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,  which could spark merchandising trends. Nevertheless, I believe personal  tastes and preferences will rise to the top of shoppers&rsquo; agendas. </p><p>This  is the theme of our new holiday campaign  &ldquo;The Gift They&rsquo;re Waiting For  Is Waiting on eBay,&rdquo; with national TV ads debuting this week. <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/hold-ebay-returns-tv-holiday/306542/\" target=\"_blank\">The ad marks</a>  our brand&rsquo;s first first holiday national television ad in nearly two  years. and expresses our mission to help shoppers find the perfect gift  at the right price.</p><p><strong>Finding Your Perfect, No Matter What It Is</strong></p><p>We  have been working for the past year on combining the power of our  selection with technology and new experiences on eBay. We know our  unique inventory is an advantage. That&rsquo;s because our listed items come  from our diverse community of sellers. Many are small businesses. And as  we all know: small businesses are a great source for personalized  gifts.  </p><p>Through investments we&rsquo;ve made on our eBay platform  technology in new browsing, navigation and discovery experiences, we  want to empower and inspire shoppers.

		"safebodyHtml": "<div><div class=\"medium-insert-images\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/hol_0.jpg\" alt=\"\"></div><p>Hoverboards were all the rage last year. Star Wars&rsquo; BB-8 flew off the  virtual shelves. Frozen commanded everyone&rsquo;s attention before that.  Tablets, smartphones and fitness trackers have headlined recent  holidays, all no-brainer gift ideas that removed the decision-making  burden for last minute shoppers.</p><p>With the holidays upon us,  retailers have been stocking their shelves &ndash; both virtual and real &ndash;  with everything from toys to clothes to smartphones to smart fitness  trackers.</p><p>However, today&rsquo;s reality is that people have more choice  and more ways to shop than ever before, but far less time. It has  become harder than ever for them to find the perfect gifts that fit  their budgets.  </p><p>Last year, about two-thirds of Americans gave up  on finding the perfect gift for someone due to lack of time or  inspiration, according to eBay&rsquo;s 2016 Holiday Survey of U.S. consumers.  Also, 81 percent of those surveyed agree that finding the perfect gift  becomes more difficult every year. Of this group, parents (90 percent)  and millennials (91 percent), in particular, said they were unable to  find the right gift.</p><p>This year we may see the smart shopper  splitting from the crowd and choosing personalized items based on the  gift-receiver&rsquo;s tastes.  </p><p><strong>A Stretched Holiday Season With An Election Thrown In</strong></p><p>The  online shopping scene is continuing to grow and evolve. This year, more  than half of the U.S population is expected to shop online, according  to Forrester Research. This is not a surprise.</p><p>I saw notable  buying trends last year as eBay fulfilled 265 million transactions  across 190 markets on great deals and gifts over the holidays. About  half of the transactions came from mobile devices. For the big four  shopping days beginning on Thanksgiving through Sunday, Nov. 29, our  mobile Gross Merchandise Bought share increased, on average, 12 percent  year-over-year.</p><p>We expect many of these trends to continue this  season. Likely more people will be shopping on mobile, and most will  still look for bigger and better deals. We know that Black Friday and  Cyber Monday are again going to be huge shopping days, and the debate  over which one is bigger will continue.</p><p>The biggest difference  this year is that the holiday season is longer. Historically, retailers  have kicked off the season the day after Halloween. But consumers are  more distracted now because of the U.S. Presidential election.</p><p>Most  retailers are expected to launch their holiday plans following the  election. Meanwhile, we have Thanksgiving falling earlier in November  than last year. All in all as compared to last year, we have a  compressed pre-holiday shopping season between election and  Thanksgiving, but a longer period of shopping time from Thanksgiving to  Christmas.</p><p>Many forecasters expect that if the election goes as  predicted, we will see a two to three  percent lift in holiday sales  overall, compared to last year.</p><p><strong>Hatchimals? Looking Beyond Hot Trends</strong></p><p>This  holiday season, no single standout gift has emerged, which represents a  significant departure from past seasons. Since shoppers aren&rsquo;t  clamoring for a specific must-have item there&rsquo;s actually more pressure  to find perfect gifts. </p><p>There are &ndash; and will always be  -- some,  trending hot items. For instance, there are toy maker Mattel&rsquo;s Barbie  doll houses with bluetooth remotes for lights and music; Hatchimals from  Spin Master; gaming consoles; virtual reality devices; drones and  seasonal clothing are already on their way to the top of the charts.  Then there is the upcoming release of Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,  which could spark merchandising trends. Nevertheless, I believe personal  tastes and preferences will rise to the top of shoppers&rsquo; agendas. </p><p>This  is the theme of our new holiday campaign  &ldquo;The Gift They&rsquo;re Waiting For  Is Waiting on eBay,&rdquo; with national TV ads debuting this week. <a href=\"http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/hold-ebay-returns-tv-holiday/306542/\" target=\"_blank\">The ad marks</a>  our brand&rsquo;s first first holiday national television ad in nearly two  years. and expresses our mission to help shoppers find the perfect gift  at the right price.</p><p><strong>Finding Your Perfect, No Matter What It Is</strong></p><p>We  have been working for the past year on combining the power of our  selection with technology and new experiences on eBay. We know our  unique inventory is an advantage. That&rsquo;s because our listed items come  from our diverse community of sellers. Many are small businesses. And as  we all know: small businesses are a great source for personalized  gifts.  </p><p>Through investments we&rsquo;ve made on our eBay platform  technology in new browsing, navigation and discovery experiences, we  want to empower and inspire shoppers. Powerful tools like price trending  and product reviews make shopping on eBay easier.  In addition our eBay  ShopBot personal shopping assistant - powered by artificial  intelligence - recently launched on Facebook Messenger. It provides a  conversational, friendly and personalized way to search for gifts.</p><p>The  holiday season is also the giving season.
